TASK 5
Introduction
The analysis aims to explore traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The dataset contains information on accidents, including date, time, weather conditions, road conditions, geographic location (latitude and longitude), and accident severity.

Data Cleaning
Missing values were checked and handled appropriately. Additional features, such as the hour of the day and day of the week, were extracted to facilitate analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Accidents by Hour of the Day
The plot shows the distribution of accidents across different hours of the day. A peak in accidents is observed during rush hours, indicating a higher risk of accidents during morning and evening commutes.

Accidents by Day of the Week
The distribution of accidents across days of the week reveals higher accident frequencies on weekdays, particularly on Fridays, which could be attributed to increased traffic and end-of-week fatigue.

Accidents by Weather Conditions
The plot shows the number of accidents under different weather conditions. Clear weather conditions have the highest number of accidents, likely due to the higher volume of traffic. Adverse weather conditions, such as rain or fog, show fewer accidents but may still pose significant risks.

Accidents by Road Conditions
The plot displays the distribution of accidents based on road conditions. Most accidents occur on dry roads, followed by wet roads, indicating that while adverse road conditions are hazardous, the sheer volume of traffic on dry roads leads to more accidents.

Accident Hotspots
A heatmap was created to visualize accident hotspots. The heatmap highlights areas with high concentrations of accidents, which can be crucial for city planners and traffic management authorities to implement safety measures.

Conclusion
The analysis of traffic accident data reveals significant patterns related to the time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and road conditions. Accidents peak during rush hours and weekdays, particularly on Fridays. Clear weather and dry road conditions see the highest number of accidents, likely due to higher traffic volumes.

The heatmap visualization of accident hotspots provides valuable insights for identifying high-risk areas, aiding in the development of targeted interventions to improve road safety. These findings can inform traffic management strategies, policy-making, and public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing traffic accidents and enhancing road safety.
